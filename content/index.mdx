**Need to gather feedback?** Whether it is on just a _thought_, or you need input for _content_ you're working on, or insights for one of your _projects_.

Simple Feedback makes it easy by enabling _Feedback Rooms_ where you can decide what to share, to whom and how.

## Getting Started

1. You need to login using a valid email address with our [passwordless login system](/login),
2. Go to our [Feedback Room](/feedback) page and create your first session,
3. Set your feedback content: can be (a) a written message, (b) embedded content, and (c) a link to external content
4. Define your Feedback Room Session options (number of users, session lifespan, and anonymity)

## Feedback Room Sessions

These sessions are created by you and for you. Only Users with your session link can visit. Here's are a couple of things to keep in mind, you can:

-   Set the number of users who have access, you can set this to any given number (_i.e. 50 users_, default is `unlimited`),
-   Set the session's lifespan, you can set this to any given number of days (_i.e. 7 days_, default is `unlimited`),
-   Allow anonymous feedback (login is still required but will not be stored with the session).
